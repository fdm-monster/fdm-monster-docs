## Breaking Changes

### MongoDB Support Removed

FDM Monster 2.0.0 removes MongoDB support entirely. All installations now use SQLite as the built-in database. This change brings several benefits:

- **Simplified setup** - No need to install or manage a separate database server
- **Better performance** - SQLite provides excellent performance for FDM Monster's use case
- **Easier backups** - Your entire database is a single file
- **Lower resource usage** - Reduced memory and CPU overhead

**Migration:** If you're running FDM Monster 1.x with MongoDB, use the YAML export feature to backup your printers and settings, then import them after upgrading to 2.0.0.

### New API Endpoint Structure

The API has been restructured to `/api/v2`. This provides a clean slate for future API evolution while maintaining stability.

## New Features

### Complete UI Redesign

FDM Monster Client Next brings a modern, responsive interface with improved usability and new features. The redesign focuses on:

- Enhanced printer grid layouts
- Better mobile support
- Improved navigation
- More intuitive workflows
- Faster load times

See the [full client release notes](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster-client-next/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.MD) for details.

### Print Queue System

The new queue system allows you to:

- Schedule multiple print jobs per printer
- Automatically start the next job when one completes
- Manage queue priorities
- View queue status across all printers

### File Analysis

Advanced file analysis provides:

- Automatic gcode metadata extraction
- Estimated print time and material usage
- Thumbnail generation support
- File compatibility checking

### Slicer Integration API

Upload directly from your slicer software with the new slicer API:

- Direct integration with popular slicers
- Automatic printer selection
- Print start control
- Progress tracking

### Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

Built-in API documentation accessible at `/swagger`:

- Interactive API testing
- Complete endpoint documentation
- Schema definitions
- Request/response examples

Configure with environment variables:

- `DISABLE_SWAGGER_OPENAPI` - Disable Swagger UI (default: false)
- `GENERATE_SWAGGER_JSON` - Generate swagger.json file (default: false)

### Tag Colors

Organize your printers better with colored tags:

- Visual categorization
- Quick identification
- Customizable colors
- Filter by tag

### Print Job History

Track your print jobs with detailed history:

- Keep records of all completed prints
- See which prints succeeded or failed
- Monitor material usage over time
- Track how long each print took

## Improvements and Fixes

### Stability Improvements

- BambuLab connection rejections can no longer cause server crashes
- Camera entity properly handles printer deletion with SET NULL foreign key
- ExceptionFilter now uses loggerFactory for better error logging
- YAML import service more robust against printer type failures

### Performance Enhancements

- Printer files load in background instead of synchronously
- Better resource management
- Optimized WebSocket connections
- Reduced memory footprint

### Bug Fixes

- Floor service position updates now work correctly (fixed x==x, y==x comparison)
- Quick stop API endpoint moved to printer controller
- File uploads now go to `media/file-uploads` instead of `media`
- First-time-setup API filter now allows Swagger endpoints
- Floor order changes properly implemented in API service
- Fixed all TypeScript strict null check issues

## Removed Features

The following experimental or unused features were removed:

- MongoDB support (breaking change)
- Experimental thumbnail support (will be redesigned)
- Custom Gcode table (unused)
- PrintCompletion table (broken, replaced by PrintJob)
- Client next experimental setting (now default)
- Batch/single gcode analysis toggle

## Technical Changes

### Architecture

- Role system reimplemented based on RoleName
- Permission system cleaned up and unused permissions removed
- Key-diff cache now uses Map instead of Object
- PrinterGroup renamed to PrinterTag for clarity

### Developer Experience

- Complete TypeScript strict null checks
- Improved dependency injection
- Better code organization
- Comprehensive API documentation

## Upgrading to 2.0.0
