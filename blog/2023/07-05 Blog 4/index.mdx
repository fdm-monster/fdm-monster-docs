## Short update 😄

I've started the work on the server login system for FDM Monster 1.5.0-rc1. This login system needs to be implemented on the frontend, which I will tackle soon! Furthermore, together with @WindArrow 's great help, I was able  work on tracking down some performance issues and associated fixes concering the reconnection of OctoPrints and preventing startup timeouts/slowdown. Some tweaking is still needed, but the server is more stable now even in case of powered down OctoPrints!

## Next week 📆

As mentioned above the login system is under development now 🔒. The client's login form and authentication guard will be built next. This will be accompanied with a user registration form ®️  and first-time setup 🗨️ . More importantly, I will add an admin setting to turn on or off login/authentication 🔓, user registration 🧑🏼‍🏭  and a role management system 🏭 . Speaking of the role system, I will also start to test this and implement a page stating "You don't have the role to perform the action at this time" 🔐 .
I will most likely release the login mechanic first and later start adding the roles. Would love to hear your feedback on what roles you would use in your farm workflow and team (and why!) 🎙️

## Feedback 💡
