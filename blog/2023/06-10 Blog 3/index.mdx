## Short update üòÑ

This week I was working hard on 1.4.0 which involved mostly ensuring that MonsterPi images could actually update to that version, and that the client 1.2.0-rcx RC webapps could be downloaded just like the non-release candidates.
It took a bit longer to build 1.4.0, but I really believe the work has paid off. Eager to fine-tune the webapp performance this week and get it out there soon!
Furthermore, I've started work on GitReleaseManager which is a tool that will create release notes automatically (and it does a bunch more) starting with MonsterPi (for now).

## Future üîç

The work after will involve mostly improving the tile system with settings for changing the action button for fine grain print control. Secondly, I'm working on a simple login system. Finally, I'm looking at converting the client webapp to Vue 3, which is definitely a lot of work - luckily I've done it before with great results. So, concluding, it's going nicely with FDM Monster right now.

Have fun printing, whether it's for the heck of it, for nice things or for your business! :monster:
Oh small side-note: [‚Å†show-and-tell](https://discord.com/channels/864835453773807686/1048129598099034112) is perfect for showing your prints, if you feel like it!
