## Current progress 💪🏼

After a lot of tinkering, the login system on the server has reached it's first usable stage. Next up: ensuring all API endpoints are authentication/role protected. (optional) registration and websocket protected. On the UI side, I'm actively working on error handling and a login page 🛡️. Furthermore I've been working on a camera page 🎦 .

## Next weeks  📆

- The login, role and user mechanisms will be finalized.
- The webcam page will be finalized  (no WebRTC yet, purely MJPEG/HTTP).
- 🪲 I will work on a OctoPrint state connection state bug
- 🪲 A batch reprint bug
- Preference: cancellation stop vs emergency stop setting (cancellation by default) for all printer tiles / sidenav

Catch you later!

David
