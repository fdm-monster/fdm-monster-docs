The documentation website has been updated!

## ðŸ“– Documentation changes

There are not much changes on the documentation itself, however some of the pages have been moved.

<!-- truncate -->

The main changes are:

- Developer documentation has been split off of the end-user documentation
  - Having the [developer documentation](/docs/developer_setup/introduction) part of the end-user documentation never made sense to me. So I have moved it to it's own section on the top of the page.
  - The URLs stayed the same, so any bookmarks should still work
- Community section added
  - The [Our Team](/docs/community/ourteam) page has been moved to the Community section
  - A new page with [external links](/docs/community/links) has been added.
- Blogs!
  - The devlogs from Discord have been moved over here!
