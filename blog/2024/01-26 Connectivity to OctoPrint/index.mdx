description: Just a quick update
---

This week I updated the connectivity to OctoPrint. I added more robust state updates, to make sure FDM Monster reports the right state in the UI.
There are more tweaks to be done, but this is already great!
I tested it on OctoPrint 1.9.3 and I plan to test 1.8.x soon, to make sure you all will have a smooth ride.

Released in: 1.6.0

When: soon™️

## Documentation

@Dyrant and me gave the [documentation](https://docs.fdm-monster.net/) a thorough review. Lots of nice tweaks are coming (not yet visible).
