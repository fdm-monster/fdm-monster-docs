## 🤗 Bit of a break

The last few weeks I've given myself a bit of a break.
This was necessary after a lot of work was done recently. It is important to take rest every now and then!
This was also a source of inspiration around this project. 💡

## 🚀  Updates

As you have seen FDM Monster reached [Unraid Community Apps](https://unraid.net/community/apps?q=fdm+monster#r). This caused a bump of new users and a lot more views on Github and the main site.
This sends a clear message that FDM Monster is in demand, but it is not easy enough to install. Platforms like Unraid make this easier. Noted!

## 🖨️ Development

I started work on Moonraker integration yesterday using a virtual klipper printer (thanks to the people at Mainsail for creating this). Fascinating how different Moonraker is compared to OctoPrint.
It is quite "open" in its API, compared to OctoPrint which locks down almost everything behind login, roles and permissions. Im eager to see the results.

## 🤔 Further notes

Im thinking about the path forward with MonsterPi. Maybe I will convert it to a setup which deploys FDM Monster with  docker and portainer.
I hope we can spark a conversation about this! Please speak up if you have thoughts about this.
