## üöÄ Updates

This week I have started the upgrade of the frontend UI of FDM Monster. I've allocated quite some time to upgrade from Vue 2 to Vue 3. Luckily, this is not the first time I'm doing this so it will be a feasible but impactful task.
I do want to emphasize that this gives mental space for Mobile Design of FDM Monster, something I've been putting off quite a while now.
