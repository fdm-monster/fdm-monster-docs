## ðŸ“– Documentation changes

We have completely rewritten the FDM Monster [MonsterPi](/docs/installing/monsterpi) documentation.

<!-- truncate -->

The main changes are:

- The Raspberry Pi Imager documentation has completely rewritten.
  - This includes a total of 13 screenshots.
- A table with suggested items has been added for your MonsterPi device.
- The Windows and Linux installations that have been deprecated for a while has been moved to the deprecated folder.
- Some sections have been reworded
- Documentation for upgrading MonsterPi images before 0.4.x has been removed. Upgrading to 0.4.x is advised.
- A [Chat on Discord](https://discord.gg/mwA8uP8CMc) link has been added to the homepage
- Soon the FDM Monster website will be redirected to the documentation.
