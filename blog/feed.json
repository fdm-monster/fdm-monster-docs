It has become clearer to me and others that the project needs a cleaner roadmap.</p>\n<p>Together with @Dyrant we've been able to formalize the roadmap and shape the work into <a href=\"https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster/milestones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github Milestones</a>\nThe result is a development cycle which slightly looks different than what was before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a set of specific features are selected for a release (version 1.6.0)</li>\n<li>in a follow-up cycle, bugs are collected, prioritized and fixed (for example 1.6.1, 1.6.2 and so on)</li>\n<li>and then the next cycle: work towards a new release starts (for example 1.7.0 with Klipper support), but also work on documentation, site and overall code quality (administration)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Milestones\" src=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/assets/images/milestones-fde1bea768f6cff8a29677043c80bfed.png\" width=\"1540\" height=\"914\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"-smooth-ride-towards-162\">ü•å Smooth ride towards 1.6.2<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/planning-update#-smooth-ride-towards-162\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to ü•å Smooth ride towards 1.6.2\" title=\"Direct link to ü•å Smooth ride towards 1.6.2\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>The updates for FDM Monster 1.6.2 have been long-awaited bugfixes!

If this is your first time diving into the FDMM server, we're excited to have you on board! üòÑ</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"-what-happened-this-week-octoprint-related\">üìÜ What Happened This Week (OctoPrint related)<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog2#-what-happened-this-week-octoprint-related\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to üìÜ What Happened This Week (OctoPrint related)\" title=\"Direct link to üìÜ What Happened This Week (OctoPrint related)\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>This week, OctoPrint released a minor update, version 1.9.0. A big shoutout to all the contributors who made this release possible! You can check out the details of the <a href=\"https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.9.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">release 1.9.0</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the notable improvements in this release is the performance boost in the file list API. We've already implemented measures to address this issue in FDMM, but this update will make our server even quicker regardless! üòä Additionally, OctoPrint now supports multi-file upload, which could come in handy for us in the future. It's definitely something we'll keep in mind!</p>\n<p>Apart from the performance enhancements, the OctoPrint team also fixed several annoying bugs in the announcements and wizard sections during setup. They even introduced a new webcam stack, which might interest you if you're in need of webcam functionality. Personally, I don't utilize it, but it's worth checking out!</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"-should-you-upgrade\">‚è´ Should You Upgrade?<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog2#-should-you-upgrade\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to ‚è´ Should You Upgrade?\" title=\"Direct link to ‚è´ Should You Upgrade?\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>If you heavily rely on OctoPrint, I would recommend holding off on upgrading to version 1.9.0 just yet. As with any new release, there may be potential changes and issues that need time to settle and be addressed. So, it's generally a good idea to exercise caution and wait for the subsequent release, 1.9.1, before making the jump.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"Ô∏è-will-fdmm-require-octoprint-190\">üõ°Ô∏è Will FDMM Require OctoPrint 1.9.0?<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog2#%EF%B8%8F-will-fdmm-require-octoprint-190\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to üõ°Ô∏è Will FDMM Require OctoPrint 1.9.0?\" title=\"Direct link to üõ°Ô∏è Will FDMM Require OctoPrint 1.9.0?\">‚Äã</a></h3>\n<p>At the moment, there is no pressing need for FDMM to require OctoPrint 1.9.0.

Rest assured, we'll always strive to ensure compatibility and provide the best experience for our users!</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"-fancy-ideas-for-fdmm\">üí° Fancy Ideas for FDMM<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog2#-fancy-ideas-for-fdmm\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to üí° Fancy Ideas for FDMM\" title=\"Direct link to üí° Fancy Ideas for FDMM\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>This week has been full of exciting experimentation for FDMM (FDM Monster)! I had the opportunity to try out some fantastic features that I can't wait to share with you:</p>\n<p>üîπ Adding Fixed Gcode Templates: One of the highlights is the addition of fixed Gcode templates. Soon, you'll be able to upload these templates to any printer after completing maintenance or access them conveniently from the right-side menu. You can prepare handy slices like benchies or build-plate cleaning Gcode there. Of course, you will need to do the slicing for your printer to avoid uploading the wrong gcode.</p>\n<p>üîπ Role-Based Authorization and Local Login: I'm thrilled to announce that role-based authorization and local login are on their way to becoming a part of FDMM (coming soon‚Ñ¢). This addition will enhance security and provide better control over user access.</p>\n<p>üîπ Repair Log: Keeping track of repairs will become easier! I'm introducing a repair log feature that allows you to track your repairs over time. This feature will be integrated into FDMM, ensuring you have a comprehensive history of your maintenance activities.</p>\n<p>üîπ Nozzle and Sheet Information: I've also made enhancements to the printer grid tile. Soon, you'll be able to see important details like nozzle type, nozzle diameter, and sheet type associated with a printer right on the grid tile. This improvement will make it more convenient to manage your printers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"-Ô∏è-whats-currently-being-worked-on\">üìö üõ†Ô∏è What's Currently Being Worked On?<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog2#-%EF%B8%8F-whats-currently-being-worked-on\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to üìö üõ†Ô∏è What's Currently Being Worked On?\" title=\"Direct link to üìö üõ†Ô∏è What's Currently Being Worked On?\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>Exciting things are happening behind the scenes at FDMM! Here's a quick update on our ongoing projects:</p>\n<p>üìö Documentation on Gitbook: Our documentation is getting a makeover! Thanks to the efforts of our amazing team member @Dumnersm, we are in the process of porting the documentation to Gitbook. This move will make it easier for everyone to access and contribute to our growing knowledge base.</p>\n<p>üõ†Ô∏è FDM Monster 1.4.0-rc1: I've been hard at work on the upcoming FDM Monster version 1.4.0-rc1. This release will introduce the new OctoPrint socket adapter, which has been a significant undertaking. The server code has undergone extensive cleanup and optimization, making it more streamlined and efficient. These improvements will enable faster feature development and pave the way for the future migration to FDMM v2.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"-whats-next\">üöÄ What's Next?<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog2#-whats-next\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to üöÄ What's Next?\" title=\"Direct link to üöÄ What's Next?\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>We have a release lined up for the near future:</p>\n<p>Server 1.3.10 Release: I'll be releasing server version 1.3.10 this week. This update will primarily focus on addressing minor bug fixes and making small tweaks to improve the overall user experience. If you encounter any issues, please report them in the ‚Å†general channel or through a GitHub issue.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

            "content_html": "<p>Hey you there! So I thought it fun to write a bit about the coding aspect of FDM Monster in a blog style. I've been wanting to share the progress in a mini article like this, so you can follow the work a bit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"-what-happened-in-may-so-far\">üìÜ What happened in May so far?<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog1#-what-happened-in-may-so-far\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to üìÜ What happened in May so far?\" title=\"Direct link to üìÜ What happened in May so far?\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>Another project, called OctoFarm, decided to call it quits, which was not unexpected given the silence on github. Even though this ending was not unexpected, it was still announced abruptly. After the announcement a small shift in the OctoPrint 3D Farm Print software ecosystem happened. Suddenly, it struck me, @Dyrant  and @Tobikiss that a replacement could be found in FDM Monster. After quite some chats with those fine aforementioned people and interesting folks like @tideline3d and @WindArrow, it was clear that FDM Monster (FDMM for short) needs a lot of improvements in order to get mature for the public. Documentation, a login system, more grid customization, a raspberry pi image (MonsterPi) and minor bugfixes were some of the topics.</p>\n<p>After these talks, a wave of people arrived into this discord and the Github suddenly showed a steady increase in view counts and clones. This gave me a big boost to work harder as now there are users using the software in their daily life, depending on it and in need of new features and expansion. It's so nice to see the project take off!</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"Ô∏è-what-was-achieved-last-weeks\">üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What was achieved last weeks<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog1#%EF%B8%8F-what-was-achieved-last-weeks\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What was achieved last weeks\" title=\"Direct link to üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What was achieved last weeks\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>With the release information in the ‚Å†releases and ‚Å†support-monsterpi in mind, you might have spotted new features started to pop up. Not only did the UI get some nice customization, the Raspberry Pi image MonsterPi was released to make running FDM Monster so much easier. Thirdly, a more professional Github workflow has slowly been adopted. For the tech savvy: the main branch is now stable and the develop branch is presented by default. The develop branch contains the latest work.\nFinally, @Dumnersm decided to put his time into contributing nice tweaks for the documentation. It's really nice to get help and to spar about new ideas!</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"-whats-next\">üîç What's Next<a href=\"https://docs.fdm-monster.net/blog/blog1#-whats-next\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to üîç What's Next\" title=\"Direct link to üîç What's Next\">‚Äã</a></h2>\n<p>It looks like @Dumnersm  is working on a new documentation system with git-book, which I'm eager to see! Personally I'm working on fixing the issue which causes the UI printer tiles to not update after a good while (hours) . This will lead to server 1.4.0-rc1 as it touched a lot of code <a href=\"https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster/issues/1632\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Issue #1632</a>. During this work I hope to make the server event-driven. This basically means that the functions in the server are triggered when needed. To give an example: \"A printer is deleted\" will result in \"the print job filename and progress state is cleared\". This is an inversion in the way FDMM was initially written. And I strongly believe it will lead to a stronger server structure soon!</p>\n<p>Do let me know if what you like to see me write about next in  ‚Å†general. Hope to update you soon with another blog.</p>\n<p>Yours truly,\nDavid</p>",
