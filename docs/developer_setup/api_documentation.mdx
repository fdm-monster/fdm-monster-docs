slug: /developer_setup/api_documentation
---

FDM Monster includes built-in API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI. This interactive documentation allows you to explore and test all available API endpoints directly from your browser.

## Accessing Swagger UI

Once FDM Monster is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

```
http://localhost:4000/api-docs
```

Or if accessing from another device on your network:

```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:4000/api-docs
```

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with your server's IP address.

## Features

The Swagger UI provides:

- **Interactive API Testing** - Try out API endpoints directly from the browser
- **Complete Endpoint Documentation** - Detailed information about all available endpoints
- **Request/Response Examples** - See example requests and responses for each endpoint
- **Schema Definitions** - View data models and their properties
- **Authentication Testing** - Test authenticated endpoints with your API token

## OpenAPI JSON Specification

The raw OpenAPI specification is available in JSON format at:

```
http://localhost:4000/api-docs/swagger.json
```

This JSON file can be:
- Imported into API testing tools like Postman or Insomnia
- Used to generate client libraries in various programming languages
- Integrated into CI/CD pipelines for API testing
- Used with code generators to create type-safe API clients

## Configuration

### Disabling Swagger

If you want to disable the Swagger UI in production, set the following environment variable:

```bash
DISABLE_SWAGGER_OPENAPI=true
```

See the [Environment Variables Guide](../configuration/environment_variables.mdx#advanced-variables) for more details.

### Generating Swagger JSON File

To generate a `swagger.json` file in your media folder, set:

```bash
GENERATE_SWAGGER_JSON=true
```

The file will be saved to `media/swagger.json`.

## API Versions

FDM Monster uses versioned API endpoints:

- **v2** - Current API version available at `/api/v2/*`
- Future versions will be added alongside existing versions to maintain compatibility

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication. To use the Swagger UI with authenticated endpoints:

1. Log in to FDM Monster in another browser tab
2. The Swagger UI will use your active session
3. Alternatively, use API keys for programmatic access

## Use Cases

### For Developers

- **Explore the API** - Understand what endpoints are available and how they work
- **Test Integration** - Try API calls before implementing them in your application
- **Debug Issues** - Test specific endpoints to isolate problems
- **Generate Clients** - Use the OpenAPI spec to generate type-safe API clients

### For Integration

The OpenAPI specification enables:
- Custom dashboard development
- Third-party integrations
- Mobile app development
- Automation scripts
- Monitoring and alerting tools

## Example: Testing an Endpoint

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/api-docs`
2. Find the endpoint you want to test (e.g., `GET /api/v2/printer`)
3. Click on the endpoint to expand it
4. Click "Try it out"
5. Fill in any required parameters
6. Click "Execute"
7. View the response below

## Common Endpoints

Some commonly used API endpoints include:

- **Printers** - `GET /api/v2/printer` - List all printers
- **Floors** - `GET /api/v2/floor` - Get printer floor layouts
- **Files** - `GET /api/v2/file` - List uploaded files
- **Settings** - `GET /api/v2/settings` - Retrieve server settings
- **Print Jobs** - `GET /api/v2/print-job` - View print job history
