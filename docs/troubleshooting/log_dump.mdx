The FDM Monster webapp has a diagnostics page that can be used to download the log files. These log files contain
information about the FDM Monster webapp, and can be used to diagnose problems. Usually, the developers will ask you
to send them the log files when you report a problem. This allows them to fix bugs and improve the software. Note that
the logs might contain personal information, such as your username or printed file names.
If you do not want to share this information, you can remove it from the log files before sending them to the developers.
