FDM Monster can expose Prometheus metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting performance issues. This is useful for tracking system health, diagnosing problems, and setting up monitoring dashboards.

## Enabling Prometheus Metrics

To enable Prometheus metrics, set the `ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_METRICS` environment variable to `true`.

**Docker Compose:**
```yaml
services:
  fdm-monster:
    environment:
      - ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_METRICS=true
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  -e ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_METRICS=true \
  fdmmonster/fdm-monster:2
```

For more configuration options, see the [Environment Variables Guide](../configuration/environment_variables.mdx#advanced-variables).

## Accessing Metrics

Once enabled, Prometheus metrics are available at:

```
http://<your-server-ip>:<your-server-port>/metrics
```

For example: `http://localhost:4000/metrics` or `http://monsterpi.local:4000/metrics`

## What Metrics Are Available?

The metrics endpoint provides various system and application metrics including:

- HTTP request durations and counts
- Active connections
- Memory usage
- Process CPU usage
- Node.js event loop metrics
- Custom application metrics

## Setting Up Prometheus

To collect these metrics with Prometheus, add FDM Monster as a scrape target in your `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'fdm-monster'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<your-server-ip>:<your-server-port>']
```

Replace `<your-server-ip>` and `<your-server-port>` with your FDM Monster server's address.

## Use Cases

Prometheus metrics are useful for:

- **Performance monitoring** - Track response times and resource usage over time
- **Troubleshooting** - Identify bottlenecks and performance issues
- **Alerting** - Set up alerts for high memory usage, slow responses, etc.
- **Capacity planning** - Understand resource usage patterns to plan scaling
