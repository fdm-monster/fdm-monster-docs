# YAML Import/Export Function

The YAML import/export function allows users to export and import their printer and floor configurations in a YAML format. 

## YAML File Format

Here is an example of a YAML file generated by the export function:

```yaml
version: 1.3.1
exportedAt: 2023-05-04T06:35:30.721Z
config:
  exportPrinters: true
  exportFloorGrid: true
  printerComparisonStrategiesByPriority:
    - name
    - url
  exportFloors: true
  floorComparisonStrategiesByPriority: floor
  notes: 'Some notes, made this layout for the summer 23'' setup '
printers:
  - id: 645351fe98d304b62a03e50d
    stepSize: 10
    enabled: true
    dateAdded: 1683182078022
    settingsAppearance:
      name: Relieved Forehead
    webSocketURL: ws://localhost/
    printerURL: http://localhost/
    apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
floors:
  - id: 64427f2d070a27047acd5e6e
    floor: 1
    name: Default Floor
    printers:
      - printerId: 645351fe98d304b62a03e50d
        x: 1
        'y': 0
```

The YAML file contains the following sections:

- **version**: The version of the YAML format used in the file.
- **exportedAt**: The date and time when the file was exported.
- **config**: The configuration settings used during the export process.
- **printers**: The list of printers and their settings.
- **floors**: The list of floors and their associated printers.
