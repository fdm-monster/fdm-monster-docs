# Updating Client Bundle

The FDM Monster Client bundle is available on two platforms, namely [Github Releases](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster-client/releases) and [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fdm-monster/client).

The client bundle is also included as an NPM package for air-gapped installations, serving as an offline fallback. 
Alternatively, and most commonly applied, the bundle is verified, downloaded, and extracted from Github during startup.

## Triggering Manual Update

To update the FDM Monster client bundle manually, navigate to the Help page and click on the **VISIT UPGRADE SETTINGS** button.
