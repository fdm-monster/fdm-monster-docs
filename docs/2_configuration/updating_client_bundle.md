The FDM Monster Client bundle is available on two platforms, namely
[Github Releases](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster-client/releases) and
[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fdm-monster/client).

The client bundle is also included as an NPM package for air-gapped installations, serving as an offline fallback.
Alternatively, and most commonly applied, the bundle is verified, downloaded, and extracted from Github during startup.
