We've listed some common questions, and we'll keep adding more!

## What is FDM Monster?

FDM Monster is an open-source 3D print farm management tool for monitoring and controlling multiple printers from a single dashboard. It supports OctoPrint, Moonraker (Klipper), PrusaLink, and Bambu Lab printers.

## Which platforms are supported?

- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) via one-click installer
- Docker / Docker Compose
- Raspberry Pi (3B+, 4, 5) via MonsterPi image
- Unraid

## What are the system requirements?

- RAM: 512MB minimum (2GB+ recommended)
- Storage: 500MB - 1GB free space
- Network: Stable connection to your printers

## Which printer firmwares are supported?

- **OctoPrint** - Full support
- **Moonraker** (Klipper) - Full support
- **PrusaLink** - Full support
- **Bambu Lab** - Work in progress

## Do I need a separate database?

No, FDM Monster uses SQLite as its built-in database. No separate database server is required.

## What about MongoDB support?

MongoDB is no longer supported since FDM Monster v2.0. The application now uses SQLite as its built-in database, which provides better performance and eliminates the need for a separate database server.

## How do I update FDM Monster?

**Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

Your data is preserved across updates when using Docker volumes or persistent storage.

## My printer shows as "offline" but it's running

Common causes:

- Incorrect IP address or hostname
- Firewall blocking connection
- Invalid or expired API key

Try accessing the printer's web interface directly to verify connectivity.
