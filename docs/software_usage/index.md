# Software Usage

The FDM Monster webapp is a web application that can be used to manage your 3D printers. It is designed to be used on a
desktop computer, and in the future it is going to be suitable for use on a tablet or mobile phone.

## Creating Printers

Please read the [Creating Printers](../software_usage/creating_printers.md) section for more information.
After creating a printer, you can place it on a floor.

## Organizing Floors

Please read the [Organizing Floors](../software_usage/organizing_floors.md) section for more information.

## Printing one GCode file

To print a file on an OctoPrint, you can upload it to the printer by dragging and dropping it on the printer.

**Batch print**
You can also upload it to the printer by clicking on the printer to select it,
and then drag and drop the file in the file upload area on the top. This allows you to upload a file to multiple
printers at once.

**Batch reprint**
You can also reprint a file on multiple printers at once by clicking on all printers involved to select them.
Then click the reprint button in the top bar. This will reprint the last file that was printed on all selected printers.
