The YAML import/export function allows users to export and import their printer and floor configurations in a YAML format.

## YAML File Format

Here is an example of a YAML file generated by the export function:

```yaml
version: 1.5.1
exportedAt: 2023-11-11T09:02:41.703Z
config:
  exportPrinters: true
  exportFloorGrid: true
  printerComparisonStrategiesByPriority:
    - name
    - url
  exportFloors: true
  floorComparisonStrategiesByPriority: floor
  notes: 'Some notes, made this layout for the summer 23'' setup '
printers:
  - id: 648f3e6d372112628bb8e404
    disabledReason: null
    enabled: true
    dateAdded: 1687109229334
    name: Dragon Eggggg
    printerURL: http://demo.fdm-monster.net:5001
    apiKey: asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdas
floors:
  - id: 64427f2d070a27047acd5e6e
    floor: 2
    name: Default Floor1_5_1
    printers:
      - floorId: 64427f2d070a27047acd5e6e
        printerId: 648f3e6d372112628bb8e404
        x: 0
        'y': 0
```

The YAML file contains the following sections:

- **version**: The version of the YAML format used in the file.
- **exportedAt**: The date and time when the file was exported.
- **config**: The configuration settings used during the export process.
- **printers**: The list of printers and their settings.
- **floors**: The list of floors and their associated printers.
