![FDM Monster Home screen](./images/home.png)

The FDM Monster home screen is the single pane of view to monitor your farm.

:::tip
The `DEFAULT FLOOR` drop-down will show all your floors when multiple are defined. The name `DEFAULT FLOOR` can be changed in the [Floors](../settings/floors.mdx) settings page.

:::info
The button `YOU HAVE NO PRINTERS. CLICK HERE TO START` is because in the screenshot, no printers are added. Printers will be added in the [Printers](../printers/index.mdx) page later in the documentation.
:::

By default, FDM Monster comes with a 8x8 grid to assign your printers. This design is based on a shelving unit design. You can change the grid in the [Grid Settings](../settings/grid_settings.mdx) page, or the cogwheel <IIcon icon="mdi:gear" /> on the right side of the window.
