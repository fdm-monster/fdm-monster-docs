# Development Setup

The NodeJS server and Vue client can be run on any platform that supports NodeJS. 
The server can be run on a Raspberry Pi, Windows, Linux or Mac. 
The client can be run on any platform that supports a modern web browser.

For Developing we advise to use a Windows or Linux machine with at least 8GB of RAM and a modern CPU.
