:::warning
For the changes in the environment variables to take effect, your FDM Monster server **must** be restarted!
:::

FDM Monster Server can be configured with environment variables. There are different ways to do this for each setup:

- specify a `.env` file. This works for these setups:
  - Windows service setup with `node-windows`
  - Linux service setup with `node-linux`
  - Node.js with `pm2`
  - Node.js with `nodemon`
- docker - specify each variable separately, this can become tedious:
  - docker: using the `-e VARIABLE=value` command repeatedly
- docker - all at once
  - docker: using the `--env-file ./.env`
    command [(Read docker options)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#options)
  - docker-compose: using the `environment`
    section [(Read docker-compose environment)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)

## Required and optional variables

:::warning
Since FDM Monster Server v1.6.0+, a new database type was added named SQLite managed with the TypeORM library.
The file-based database SQLite allows for a standalone FDM Monster setup without MongoDB.
Hence, no running MongoDB database would be required, if this new mode is enabled.
Enable this mode by setting `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_TYPEORM=true`. You do not have to specify `MONGO` anymore in that case!
The `MONGO` variable will be ignored by FDM Monster.

Also note that no data is migrated from MongoDB to SQLite. You can use YAML export & import for migrating most data.

This new mode is experimental, although it has been tested quite a bit. We hope you are in the position to provide
feedback
in case of errors or unexpected behaviour!
:::

The following variables are read and used by FDM Monster at startup. Always restart your server after a change.

- `MONGO` (Optional, required before 1.6.x) **the connection to mongodb**. For example:

> `MONGO=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/fdm-monster`

- `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_TYPEORM` (Optional) **a flag indicating SQLite should be used instead of MongoDB. Setting it to
  exactly `true` will enable this new mode.**

- `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_TYPEORM=true`

- `SERVER_PORT` (Optional, default=4000) **the port of the local FDM Monster website**. For example:

> `SERVER_PORT=4000`

## The `.env` file

A very simple text file with a variable per line. The following `.env` is often already enough to make sure FDM Monster
works as you like:

```dotenv
MONGO=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/fdm-monster
SERVER_PORT=4000
```

Alternatively, the new SQLite (TypeORM) mode can be enabled as such:

```dotenv
ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_TYPEORM=true
SERVER_PORT=4000
```

## Applying it to your setup

So, you understand the variables to configure FDM Monster now. How do I set this up for my environment? Read below for
your specific scenario.

### Node.js with node-linux, node-windows or pm2

Create a `.env` file in the `fdm-monster/server` folder with the **required** and/or _optional_ variables by copying
the `.env.template` file.
Copy this and rename it to `.env` to get started quicker.
The server will automatically create the `.env` file for you, and the server logs will show what is going wrong if
something is missing.

Feel adventurous? Customize the file to your liking, but again ALWAYS make sure the **required** variables are correctly
set.

### Docker-compose

With docker-compose you have a great tool to pass environment variables use the `environment` section.
Here is how the environment section in docker would look.

```yaml
services:
  fdm-monster:
    # ... other sections here
    environment:
      #       To use SQLite / TypeORM instead:
      #      - ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_TYPEORM=true
      - MONGO: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/fdm-monster
      - SERVER_PORT: 4000
```

Please continue by reading the [Docker Compose section](../installing/docker_compose.mdx) for more information on how
to setup FDM Monster and MongoDB with docker-compose.
