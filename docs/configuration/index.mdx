Before starting the FDM Monster server it is possible to adjust configuration.
Once the server has started, you can adjust settings on the settings page.

The webapp client bundle can be updated on the fly, without restarting the server.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
