## Quick Install with `curl`

Install FDM Monster with a single command on **Ubuntu / Debian / Raspberry Pi OS**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster-scripts/main/install/linux/install.sh | bash
```

[View Installation Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster-scripts/main/install/linux/install.sh)

## What the Installer Does

The one-click installer will automatically:

1. Detect your platform and architecture (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, etc.)
1. Install Node.js 24+ if not already present
1. Set up Yarn via corepack
1. Install `@fdm-monster/server` package
1. Create and start systemd service
1. Create CLI wrapper at `~/.local/bin/fdm-monster` (alias: `fdmm`)
1. Display access URLs and management commands

After installation completes, FDM Monster will be:

- Running as a systemd service
- Accessible at `http://localhost:4000`
- Manageable via the `fdmm` CLI command

## Requirements

- **Linux**: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Arch, or similar
- **RAM**: 512MB minimum (2GB+ recommended)
- **Storage**: 500MB - 1GB free space
- **Architecture**: x86_64 (amd64), ARM64, or ARMv7
- **Raspberry Pi**: Compatible with Pi 3B+, Pi 4, and Pi 5

The installer will automatically install Node.js 24+ if it's not already present on your system.

## Installation Directories

After installation, FDM Monster will use these directories:

- **Install directory**: `~/.fdm-monster`
  - Contains the FDM Monster server installation
- **Data directory**: `~/.fdm-monster-data`
  - Contains your database and media files (logs, uploads, etc.)
- **CLI location**: `~/.local/bin/fdm-monster`
  - The `fdmm` command-line tool

## Management Commands

After installation, use the `fdmm` command (or `fdm-monster`) to manage your installation:

```bash
# View CLI version
fdmm version

# Check if FDM Monster is running
fdmm status

# View logs in real-time
fdmm logs
```

### Service Control

```bash
# Start FDM Monster
fdmm start

# Stop FDM Monster
fdmm stop

# Restart FDM Monster
fdmm restart
```

### Updates and Upgrades

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
fdmm upgrade

# Upgrade to a specific version (see GitHub releases)
fdmm upgrade 2.x.y

# Update the CLI tool itself
fdmm update-cli
```

Find available versions on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster/releases).

### Backup and Maintenance

```bash
# Backup your data directory
fdmm backup

# Reinstall FDM Monster
fdmm install

# Uninstall FDM Monster completely
fdmm uninstall
```

:::info
The `fdmm uninstall` command will ask you whether to delete your data folder. Use `fdmm backup` first if you want to keep a backup of your data.
:::

## Accessing FDM Monster

After installation, the installer will display all available access URLs. Typically:

```bash
http://localhost:4000
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:4000
```

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with your server's IP address to access from other devices on your network.

## Customization

### Environment Variables

FDM Monster can be configured using environment variables. These are stored in a `.env` file located in your data directory at `~/.fdm-monster-data/.env`.

To customize your installation:

```bash
# Stop FDM Monster
fdmm stop

# Edit the .env file
nano ~/.fdm-monster-data/.env
```

Add or modify environment variables:

```bash
# Change the server port
SERVER_PORT=8080

# Set environment mode
NODE_ENV=production

# Authentication settings
OVERRIDE_LOGIN_REQUIRED=true
OVERRIDE_REGISTRATION_ENABLED=false
```

Save the file and restart FDM Monster:

```bash
fdmm start
```

For a complete list of available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables Guide](../configuration/environment_variables.mdx).

:::warning
Do not edit the systemd service file directly as it may break configuration overrides. Always use the `.env` file in your data directory instead.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation, ensure you have write access to:

- `~/.fdm-monster` (install directory)
- `~/.fdm-monster-data` (data directory)
- `~/.local/bin` (CLI directory)

### Service Won't Start

Check the service status and logs:

```bash
# Check systemd service status
sudo systemctl status fdm-monster

# View logs
fdmm logs
```

### Port Already in Use

If port 4000 is already in use, see the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section above to change the port.

### Cannot Access from Other Devices

Make sure your firewall allows connections on port 4000:

```bash
# For UFW (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo ufw allow 4000/tcp

# For firewalld (Fedora/CentOS)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=4000/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Command Not Found: fdmm

If the `fdmm` command is not found after installation, ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

## Upgrading FDM Monster

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
fdmm upgrade
```

To upgrade to a specific version (find versions on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster/releases)):

```bash
fdmm upgrade 2.x.y
```

Your data in `~/.fdm-monster-data` is automatically preserved during upgrades.

## Backup and Restore

### Backup

Use the built-in backup command:

```bash
fdmm backup
```

This will create a timestamped backup file in `~/.fdm-monster-backups/`:

```bash
Backup created: ~/.fdm-monster-backups/fdm-monster-20260111-161209.tar.gz
```

### Restore

To restore from a backup:

```bash
# Stop FDM Monster
fdmm stop

# Extract the backup to restore your data
tar -xzf ~/.fdm-monster-backups/fdm-monster-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz -C ~/

# Start FDM Monster
fdmm start
```

Replace `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` with the actual timestamp from your backup filename.

## Uninstalling

To remove FDM Monster:

```bash
# Uninstall
fdmm uninstall
```

This will:

- Stop the systemd service
- Remove the service file
- Delete the installation directory (`~/.fdm-monster`)
- Remove the CLI tool (`~/.local/bin/fdm-monster`)
- Ask whether to delete the data directory (`~/.fdm-monster-data`) - defaults to keeping it

:::tip
Your data directory is preserved by default during uninstall. Use `fdmm backup` before uninstalling if you want an additional backup.
:::
