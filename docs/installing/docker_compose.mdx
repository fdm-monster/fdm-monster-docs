:::info
Familiarity with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is required.

:::tip
We simply cannot support custom scenarios or setups. Therefore, it is essential to check your device's memory limits, architecture, and CPU power.

## Running FDM Monster with Docker Compose

In the next steps, we will guide you through the process of running FDM Monster with Docker Compose.

### Step 1: FDM Monster image and version tag

We provide the `fdmmonster/fdm-monster` image. This image requires you to run a MongoDB server, MongoDB Atlas (cloud offering), or a MongoDB docker container (see compose file below).
Find it on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fdmmonster/fdm-monster/tags).

There are multiple tags available for the `fdmmonster/fdm-monster` image.

- `latest` - The latest version of FDM Monster. This is the default tag.
- `x`, `x.y`, `x.y.z` - A specific version of FDM Monster. For example, `1`, `1.4`, or `1.4.0`.
- `main` - The latest development version of FDM Monster. This version is the same as the `latest` tag and it is stable.
- `develop` - The latest development version of FDM Monster. This version is not recommended for production use.
- `x.y.z-rc?-1234` - A specific release candidate of FDM Monster with a specific build number. For example, `1.4.0-rc1-1234`. These are development versions and are not recommended for production use.
- `x.y.z-1234` - A specific version of FDM Monster with a specific build number. For example, `1.4.0-1234`. These are development versions and are not recommended for production use.

### Step 2: Create a docker-compose.yml file

To run a Docker Compose stack, create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and use the file contents presented below. Note that an option has been added for adding MongoDB authentication.
If you choose not to use authentication, you can remove the `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variables.
In that case, you should leave out the `<username>:<password>@` part of the `MONGO` environment variable.

:::warning
It's important to protect your MongoDB database with authentication. If you choose not to use authentication, you should at least use a firewall to protect your database.
Do not simply expose your database over the internet without any protection! You have been warned.
:::

There is also a development (`NODE_ENV=development`) compose file here: [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/fdm-monster/fdm-monster/tree/main/docker-compose.yml)):

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml example"
version: '3.4'

services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: mongodb
    restart: always
    healthcheck:
      test: echo 'db.runCommand("ping").ok' | mongosh localhost:27017/test --quiet
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 40s
    environment:
      # MongoDB with authentication (advised!)
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=YOUR_ROOT_NAME
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD
    volumes:
      - ./mongodb-data:/data/db
      - ./mongoconfig:/data/configdb

  fdm-monster:
    container_name: fdm-monster
    image: fdmmonster/fdm-monster:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: curl --fail http://localhost:4000 || exit 1
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 40s
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    environment:
      # MongoDB with and without authentication (advised!)
      - MONGO=mongodb://YOUR_ROOT_NAME:YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD@mongodb:27017/fdm-monster?authSource=admin
      # - MONGO=mongodb://mongodb:27017/fdm-monster?authSource=admin
    volumes:
      - ./fdm-monster/media:/app/media
```

_An example of a docker-compose.yml file with the MongoDB and FDM-Monster services in one stack._

:::info
By default the `mongodb` service is not exposed to your local network. To expose MongoDB add the lines below right above the `environment` line.

```yaml
    ports:
      - "28017:27017"
```

:::

### Step 3: Execute the docker-compose stack

Execute this command to run the containers:

```powershell
docker-compose up -d
```

Please note that FDM Monster requires a MongoDB database to function properly. When using the `latest` or `alpine` images,
make sure to configure your root user's username and password for MongoDB.
Additionally, FDM Monster needs to access the `admin` table, which is the default table name for the authentication source.

Now you can access FDM Monster at `http://localhost:4000`, `http://127.0.0.1:4000`, or `http://<your-ip>:4000`.
