Even though this ending was not unexpected, it was still announced abruptly. After the announcement a small shift in the OctoPrint 3D Farm Print software ecosystem happened. Suddenly, it struck me, @Dyrant  and @Tobikiss that a replacement could be found in FDM Monster. After quite some chats with those fine aforementioned people and interesting folks like @tideline3d and @WindArrow, it was clear that FDM Monster (FDMM for short) needs a lot of improvements in order to get mature for the public. Documentation, a login system, more grid customization, a raspberry pi image (MonsterPi) and minor bugfixes were some of the topics."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After these talks, a wave of people arrived into this discord and the Github suddenly showed a steady increase in view counts and clones.
