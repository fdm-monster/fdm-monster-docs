Even though this ending was not unexpected, it was still announced abruptly. After the announcement a small shift in the OctoPrint 3D Farm Print software ecosystem happened. Suddenly, it struck me, @Dyrant  and @Tobikiss that a replacement could be found in FDM Monster. After quite some chats with those fine aforementioned people and interesting folks like @tideline3d and @WindArrow, it was clear that FDM Monster (FDMM for short) needs a lot of improvements in order to get mature for the public. Documentation, a login system, more grid customization, a raspberry pi image (MonsterPi) and minor bugfixes were some of the topics."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After these talks, a wave of people arrived into this discord and the Github suddenly showed a steady increase in view counts and clones.

Thirdly, a more professional Github workflow has slowly been adopted. For the tech savvy: the main branch is now stable and the develop branch is presented by default. The develop branch contains the latest work.\nFinally, @Dumnersm decided to put his time into contributing nice tweaks for the documentation.

During this work I hope to make the server event-driven. This basically means that the functions in the server are triggered when needed.
